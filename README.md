# aws-amplify-demosite

Demo website for use with AWS tutorial https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/

## Step 1 setup

Clone the demo website from s3 to this repo

## Deploy with amplify

You can manually deploy a static site to an s3 bucket and manage updates yourself, or Amplify can do it with one touch.  Connect amplify to your git repo, and the branch you want to use for deployment.  Each time you push to that branch your site will be automatically redeployed.
